This directory is intended to contain the service component for
the Core Banking project (i. e. JAX-RS endpoints etc.).

== PACKAGING ==

To package the files for deployment in a JEE Servlet container, use:

  mvn package

== DEPLOYING TO TOMCAT ==

The pom.xml file contains a tomcat7-maven-plugin (also works with
later versions) configuration that uses the server name
"Tomcat-Techupdate" with the default URL. To use it: 

(1) Create a suitable user in tomcat-users.xml with the roles
    manager-html,manager-script.
(2) Create a configuration in settings.xml that assigns this user
    to the server name:

    [...]
    <servers>
        <server>
            <id>Tomcat-Techupdate</id>
            <username>USERNAME_CREATED_IN_STEP_1</username>
            <password>PASSWORD_CHOSEN_IN_STEP_1</password>
        </server>
    </servers>
    [...]
(3) Deploy with "mvn tomcat7:deploy" or "mvn tomcat7:redeploy". If
    your Tomcat is at a different URL, use
    "mvn -Dtomcat.url=http://host:port/manager/text tomcat7:deploy" etc.
    You can also create a default profile in settings.xml that sets
    that property.
