This directory contains the Angular front-end application for the Core
Banking project. It started off as an angular-seed copy and it is expected 
that the node.js based test & development machinery continues to work.

While it can be packaged with Maven, this is really independent of Angular.
It can perfectly well be deployed using other tools, as it's only
static content from the web server's point of view.

The original LICENSE and README.md files are available as LICENSE.seed
README.seed.md, respectively.

== BOOTSTRAPPING ==

You need npm.

Install Angular prerequisites by executing:

  npm install

This only needs to be done once (except in cases when Angular needs to
be updated).

== PACKAGING ==

To package the files for deployment in a JEE Servlet container, use:

  mvn package

== DEPLOYING TO TOMCAT ==

The pom.xml file contains a tomcat7-maven-plugin (also works with
later versions) configuration that uses the server name
"Tomcat-Techupdate" with the default URL. To use it:

(1) Create a suitable user in tomcat-users.xml with the roles
    manager-html,manager-script.
(2) Create a configuration in settings.xml that assigns this user
    to the server name:

    [...]
    <servers>
        <server>
            <id>Tomcat-Techupdate</id>
            <username>USERNAME_CREATED_IN_STEP_1</username>
            <password>PASSWORD_CHOSEN_IN_STEP_1</password>
        </server>
    </servers>
    [...]

== RUNNING LOCALLY (NODE) ==

To run with Node's development server, use:

  npm start

Due to Same Origin Policy, that variant is not really useful at the moment
though as communication with the JAX-RS endpoint is impossible.
