This directory contains the Angular front-end application for the Core
Banking project. It started off as an angular-seed copy and it is expected 
that the node.js based test & development machinery continues to work.

While it can be packaged with Maven, this is really independent of Angular.
It can perfectly well be deployed using other tools, as it's only
static content from the web server's point of view.

The original LICENSE and README.md files are available as LICENSE.seed
README.seed.md, respectively.

== BOOTSTRAPPING ==

You need npm.

Install Angular prerequisites by executing:

  npm install

This only needs to be done once (except in cases when Angular needs to
be updated).

== PACKAGING ==

To package the files for deployment in a JEE Servlet container, use:

  mvn package
